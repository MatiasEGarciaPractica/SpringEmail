# How to send a email with spring

### To have in consideration
To work, you need to add an email.properties with :
- email.username : your email.
- email.password : your generated application password.

I don't have these properties here because are private.

Where you get these properties?

Only in the case of Gmail:

You have to go to : https://myaccount.google.com:
- You have to activate your 2 steps verification.
- Search for application passwords.
- And then create your password for this test.
